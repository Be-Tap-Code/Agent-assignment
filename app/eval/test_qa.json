    "question": "How is cone resistance data used in Settle3 CPT analysis?",
    "expected_answer": "Settle3 uses cone resistance (qc) data to estimate soil strength and settlement characteristics. It is used directly in settlement calculations, in Schmertmann and Mayne & Poulos methods, and to determine soil parameters like Young's modulus, friction angle, and overconsolidation ratio. Normalized cone resistance and friction ratio are also used for soil classification, influencing settlement predictions.",

    "expected_answer": "Settle3 considers soil properties such as grain size distribution, plasticity index, relative density or SPT N-values, groundwater conditions, and stress history for liquefaction assessment. It uses corrected SPT N-values or normalized cone resistance depending on the method, and key parameters like cyclic stress ratio, cyclic resistance ratio, factor of safety, and magnitude scaling factor are also accounted for. Post-liquefaction settlement can be estimated using methods such as Ishihara & Yoshimine (1992) and Zhang et al (2002).",

The corresponding ultimate load is 1519.2 kN (q_ult × B × 1 m). The applied load of 500 kN is less than the ultimate load, indicating adequate capacity. Immediate settlement calculation cannot be performed without additional soil parameters (e.g., modulus of elasticity), so Settle3 methods cannot be fully applied.
